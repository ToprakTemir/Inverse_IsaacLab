## How to collect demonstrations:

1) navigate to InverseAssemblyProject/scripts/inverse/disassembly
2) /home/toprak/IsaacLab/isaaclab.sh      -p /home/toprak/IsaacLab/scripts/tools/record_demos.py     --task Disassembly-UR3e-IK-v0     --teleop_device keyboard     --dataset_file ./datasets/dataset.hdf5     --num_demos 10


Custom record and replay demos are supposed to be pasted to your isaaclab environment's corresponding files
